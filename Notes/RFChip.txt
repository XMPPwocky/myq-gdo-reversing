[[SiLabs]] Si4432 transceiver IC. Wideband (240-930MHz).

Interface is allegedly 3-wire SPI.

No obvious references to this chip in [[WifiModule:Firmware]] . Which means it must be in [[PIC18F:Firmware]] - makes sense, and is probably a decent part of the reason the PIC exists.

The device needs to actually talk to a garage door opener - despite its name it isn't really a smart garage door opener because it isn't a garage door opener at all. It's just an IP (wifi) to RF (rolling code) bridge! This chip is doing that.

There's two antennas - one white, one black. Are both connected to the radio chip? Maybe they're for different bands?
