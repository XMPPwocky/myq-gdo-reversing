====== RFChip ======
Created Wednesday 30 December 2020

[[SiLabs]] transceiver. Wideband (something like 200-800mhz? )

[ ] fill this in from datasheet

The device needs to actually talk to a garage door opener - despite its name it isn't really a smart garage door opener because it isn't a garage door opener at all. It's just a [[WiFi]] to RF (rolling code) bridge! This chip is doing that.

There's two antennas - one white, one black. Are both connected to the radio chip? Maybe they're for different bands? 
[ ] Investigate antenna situation.
