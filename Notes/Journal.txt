Improved the tool to talk to the [[WifiModule:DebugUART]] 

Read more documentation about [[WifiModule:RTL8721D:CoreSight]] . Not quite as useful as I thought it might be for dumping the [[WifiModule:RTL8721D:ROM]] , but the Flash Patch Breakpoint is definitely worth using.

poked at the [[WifiModule:SPIFlash]] some more, disabled the [[RTL8721D]]'s MPU and tried reading the ITCM [[WifiModule:RTL8721D:ROM]] (without success), but did find that some of the ITCM can be read as data! So that's weird.

TODO: Investigate that further (but not too urgent, because I have symbols for the [[WifiModule:RTL8721D:ROM]] )
