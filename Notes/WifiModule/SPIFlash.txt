SPI flash dump: [[/dumps/backup.bin]]

Contains [[Firmware]] for the module... I don't see anything else in it.

TODO: The SPI flash dump looks different than the dump (from the device itself) of flash (with [[DebugUART]] commands). Why? The dump from the [[DebugUART]] repeats itself. Is it just mapped multiple times / ignoring address bits, or is something weird going on with the [[RTL8721D:RSIPMMU]] ?
