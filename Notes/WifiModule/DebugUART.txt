====== DebugUART ======
Created Wednesday 30 December 2020

On the WifiModule, main entry point so far.

Initially showed up, deceptively, as an AT command shell. Some AT commands do let you edit RAM, but the really fun ones aren't AT commands at all.

Known (useful) commands:

* DW (address hex): read a little-endian uint32 from RAM;
* EW (address hex) (value hex) to write the same
* reboot: duh
* flash read (address) (length) - careful, will crash if you miss an argument
* ? - print SOME (not all!) commands

Indications that there are two CPUs (K0 and K4). Why? (Likely just that one's a power management controller or something like that.) ">>" command to switch the UART from talking to one to the other.

Earlier, when causing boot to fail intentionally, the RTL chip would try and download firmware over the UART... very risky, avoid playing around with this.
