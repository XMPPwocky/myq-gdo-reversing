====== ROM ======
Created Thursday 31 December 2020

Both ITCM and DTCM. Obnoxiously, you can't dump the ITCM via the normal [[DebugUART]] DW/EW commands, because it's not readable as data... maybe tricks with CoreSight?

TODO

But the SDK (linked from [[RTL8721D]]) does have symbols for most of the ROM! This is very lucky since things like strcpy, memcpy, memcmp, etc. are all ROM routines,
