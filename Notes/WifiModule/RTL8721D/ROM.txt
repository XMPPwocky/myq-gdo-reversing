====== ROM ======
Created Thursday 31 December 2020

Both ITCM and DTCM.

~~Obnoxiously, you can't dump the ITCM via the normal DebugUART DW/EW commands, because it's not readable as data~~... maybe tricks with CoreSight? Hmmmm. You can dump some of it... what's up? Even disabling the MPU didn't seem to change anything. Very weird.

TODO: look into [[CoreSight]]

But the SDK (linked from [[RTL8721D]]) does have symbols for most of the ROM! This is very lucky since things like strcpy, memcpy, memcmp, etc. are all ROM routines,
